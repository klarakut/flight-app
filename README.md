# flight-app

My flight search app is an application for looking flights.

The application queries flight APIs for flight information and sends notifications to WhatsUp about matched flights.
This is a backend application, and I use Postman for functionality testing.

I am using:

  -> Kiwi Tequila API, to get information about flights
  
  -> CallMeBot API to send notifications to WhatsUp
